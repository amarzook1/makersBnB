# Project Description

A web application which allows users to **list** spaces which they have **avaliable** for a price, and allow users to **browse** for these available spaces and **booked** them for a specific amount of time.

## Specification
-   Any signed-up user can list a new space.
    
-   Users can list multiple spaces.
    
-   Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
    
-   Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
    
-   Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
    
-   Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
    
-   Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
